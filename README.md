# Lab Experiment 6 – Combined-UX-Design-Scenarios
## AIM

To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design through a known UX problem, improving the understanding of user-centered design processes.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Booking an appointment in hospital apps is often confusing or inefficient, leading to user frustration, missed appointments, and poor healthcare experience.

## DESIGN STEPS

### 1. Solution Ideation
 
  • Conducted Crazy 8s and Brainwriting exercises to generate multiple low-fidelity ideas addressing appointment booking challenges.
  
  • Explored diverse approaches like simplified calendar views, smart reminders, chatbots, and quick rebooking options.

### 2. Creating User Stories
Based on personas and goals, wrote user stories to capture requirements clearly:

  • As a patient, I want to quickly find available appointment slots, so that I can schedule visits without waiting.

  • As a busy professional, I want to receive reminders via SMS and app notifications, so that I don’t forget my appointment.

  • As an elderly user, I want large fonts and simple navigation, so that I can easily book without confusion.

  • As a new patient, I want clear instructions on required documents for appointments, so that I can prepare ahead.

  • As a caregiver, I want to book appointments on behalf of the patient, so that I can assist effectively.

### 3. Creating Scenarios

Selected user story: "As a busy professional, I want to receive reminders via SMS and app notifications, so that I don’t forget my appointment."

 #### Scenario Narrative:
 
John is a 35-year-old marketing manager with a hectic schedule. He uses the hospital app to book a specialist appointment. Feeling stressed about his workload, John appreciates the app sending him a reminder two days before his appointment via SMS and a notification on his phone. This helps him adjust his calendar and avoid missing the visit. The app’s simple design makes it easy to confirm or reschedule appointments on the go.

### 4. Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping

Task chosen: Booking an appointment in the hospital app.

User Flow includes:

  • Start: User opens the app
  
  • Action: Select 'Book Appointment'
  
  • Decision: Choose department or specialist
  
  • Action: Pick available date/time
  
  • Decision: Confirm or reschedule
  
  • Action: Provide patient details
  
  • Action: Receive confirmation message
  
  • End: Appointment booked successfully

### 5. Information Architecture (IA)

  • Conducted closed card sorting with 10 participants using common hospital app features (e.g., Appointments, Prescriptions, Billing, Profile, Notifications).
  
  • Created a sitemap organizing the app into main categories: Home, Appointments, Medical Records, Billing, Support.
  
  • Designed navigation hierarchy ensuring quick access to frequently used features like booking and reminders.

## RESULT

• Multiple ideas generated from ideation provided innovative ways to ease appointment booking.

• User stories clarified diverse user needs and improved feature prioritization.

• Scenario narratives highlighted emotional contexts, enhancing empathy.

• User flow diagrams mapped a clear, logical booking process.

• IA design optimized information grouping and navigation paths.

## CONCLUSION

This combined UX exercise reinforces the importance of iterative ideation, user-centered storytelling, clear task flows, and structured information architecture for designing effective and accessible hospital appointment booking apps.
